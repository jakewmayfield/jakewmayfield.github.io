    <h2>God Who Listens</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="new_song">
        <h5>Verse 1</h5>
        <p>The God who made the winters and the summers</p>
        <p>The One who put the stars all in their place</p>
        <p> The only One who stands above all others</p>
        <p>He knows me by name</p>
        <br>

        <p>The angels hide their faces in His presence</p>
        <p>The demons run for cover when You speak</p>
        <p>You rule the world and reign above the heavens</p>
        <p>And still draw close to me</p>
        <br>
        <p>And when I close my eyes</p>
        <p>I know that</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p>I'm not just hopin', I'm not just wishin'</p>
        <p>I know I'm prayin' to a God who listens</p>
        <p>I know He hears me, I know He's livin'</p>
        <p> Yes, I am prayin' to a God who listens</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Verse 2</h5>
        <p>He walks with me and leads me by still waters</p>
        <p>I lay my troubles down at His feet</p>
        <p>It's amazing that the Savior and the Father</p>
        <p>He is a friend to me</p>
        <p>How can it be</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p>I'm not just hopin', I'm not just wishin'</p>
        <p>I know I'm prayin' to a God who listens</p>
        <p>I know He hears me, I know He's livin'</p>
        <p>Yes, I am prayin'to a God who listens</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Bridge</h5>
        <p> Who knows me, who loves me</p>
        <p> Who never will fail me</p>
        <p> Who tells me that I am His own</p>
        <br>
        <p> And You surround me, remind me</p>
        <p>You always are for me</p>
        <p>So I come boldly to Your throne</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p>I'm not just hopin', I'm not just wishin'</p>
        <p>I know I'm prayin' to a God who listens</p>
        <p>I know He hears me, I know He's livin'</p>
        <p>Yes, I am prayin'to a God who listens</p>
