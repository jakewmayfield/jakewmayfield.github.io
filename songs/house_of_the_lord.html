    <div class="new_song">
        <h5>Verse 1</h5>
        <p>We worship the God who was</p>
        <p>We worship the God who is</p>
        <p>We worship the God who evermore will be</p>
        <br>

        <p> He opened the prison doors</p>
        <p>He parted the raging sea</p>
        <p>My God, He holds the victory</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p>There's joy in the house of the Lord</p>
        <p>There's joy in the house of the Lord today</p>
        <p>And we won't be quiet</p>
        <p>We shout out Your praise</p>
        <br>

        <p>There's joy in the house of the Lord</p>
        <p>Our God is surely in this place</p>
        <p>And we won't be quiet</p>
        <p>We shout out Your praise</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Verse 2</h5>
        <p>We sing to the God who heals</p>
        <p>We sing to the God who saves</p>
        <p>We sing to the God who always makes a way</p>
        <br>

        <p>'Cause He hung up on that cross</p>
        <p>Then He rose up from that grave</p>
        <p>My God's still rolling stones away</p>
        <br>

        <h5>horus</h5>
        <p>There's joy in the house of the Lord</p>
        <p>There's joy in the house of the Lord today</p>
        <p>And we won't be quiet</p>
        <p>We shout out Your praise</p>
        <br>

        <p>There's joy in the house of the Lord</p>
        <p>Our God is surely in this place</p>
        <p>And we won't be quiet</p>
        <p>We shout out Your praise</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Bridge</h5>
        <p>We were the beggars</p>
        <p>Now we're royalty</p>
        <p>We were the prisoners</p>
        <p>Now we're running free</p>
        <br>

        <p> We are forgiven, accepted</p>
        <p> Redeemed by His grace</p>
        <p>Let the house of the Lord sing praise</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p>There's joy in the house of the Lord</p>
        <p>There's joy in the house of the Lord today</p>
        <p>And we won't be quiet</p>
        <p>We shout out Your praise</p>
        <br>

        <p>There's joy in the house of the Lord</p>
        <p>Our God is surely in this place</p>
        <p>And we won't be quiet</p>
        <p>We shout out Your praise</p>
