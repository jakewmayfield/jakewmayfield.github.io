        <h5>Verse 1</h5>
        <p>If my heart could tell a story</p>
        <p>If my life would sing a song</p>
        <p>If I have a testimony</p>
        <p>If I have anything at all</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p> No one ever cared for me like Jesus</p>
        <p> His faithful hand has held me all this way</p>
        <p> And when I'm old and grey</p>
        <p>And all my days are numbered on the earth</p>
        <p>Let it be known in you alone</p>
        <p>My joy was found</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Verse 2</h5>
        <p> Let my children tell their children</p>
        <p> Let this be their memory</p>
        <p> That all my treasure was in heaven</p>
        <p> And you were everything to me</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p> No one ever cared for me like Jesus</p>
        <p> His faitful hand has held me all this way</p>
        <p> And when I'm old and grey</p>
        <p> And all my days are numbered on the earth</p>
        <p> Let it be known in you alone</p>
        <p> My joy was found
        <br>
        <h5>Bridge</h5>
        <p> I've found my joy</p>
        <p> I'm still in love</p>
        <p>Your still enough for me</p>
        <p>Still all I want</p>
        <p>Your still my everything</p>
        <p> I'm still in love</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p> No one ever cared for me like Jesus</p>
        <p> His faitful hand has held me all this way</p>
        <p>And when I'm old and grey</p>
        <p> And all my days are numbered on the earth</p>
        <p>Let it be known in you alone</p>
        <p>My joy was found</p>
