    <div class="new_song">
        <h5>Verse 1</h5>
        <p>Let praise be a weapon</p>
        <p>that silences the enemy</p>
        <p>Let praise be a weapon </p>
        <p>that conquers all anxiety</p>
        <br>
        <p>Let it rise, let praise arise</p>
        <br>
        <p> We sing Your name in the dark </p>
        <p> and it changes everything</p>
        <p>We sing with all we are </p>
        <p>and we claim Your victory</p>
        <br>
        <p>Let it rise, let praise arise</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p>We'll see You break down every wall</p>
        <p> We'll watch the giants fall</p>
        <p> Fear cannot survive when we praise You</p>
        <br>
        <p>The God of breakthrough's on our side</p>
        <p>Forever we lift Him high</p>
        <p>With all creation cry, God, we praise You</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Verse 2</h5>
        <p> Let faith be the song </p>
        <p>that overcomes the raging sea</p>
        <p>Let faith be the song that </p>
        <p>calms the storm inside of me</p>
        <br>
        <p>Let it rise, let faith arise</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p> We'll see You break down every wall</p>
        <p>We'll watch the giants fall</p>
        <p>Fear cannot survive when we praise You</p>
        <br>
        <p>The God of breakthrough's on our side</p>
        <p> Forever lift Him high</p>
        <p> With all creation cry, God, we praise You</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Bridge</h5>
        <p>This is what living looks like</p>
        <p>This is what freedom feels like</p>
        <p>This is what Heaven sounds like</p>
        <p>We praise You, we praise You</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p> We'll see You break down every wall</p>
        <p>We'll watch the giants fall</p>
        <p>Fear cannot survive when we praise You</p>
        <br>
        <p>The God of breakthrough's on our side</p>
        <p>Forever lift Him high</p>
        <p>With all creation cry, God, we praise You</p>
