        <h5>Verse 1</h5>
        <p>I just want to speak the name of Jesus</p>
        <p> Over every heart and every mind</p>
        <p>'Cause I know there is peace </p>
        <p>within your presence</p>
        <p>I speak Jesus
        <br>
        <h5>Verse 2</h5>
        <p>I just want to speak the name of Jesus</p>
        <p>'Til every dark addiction starts to break</p>
        <p>Declaring there is hope and </p>
        <p>there is freedom</p>
        <p>I speak Jesus</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p> 'Cause your name is power</p>
        <p> Your name is healing</p>
        <p>Your name is life</p>
        <br>
        <p>Break every stronghold</p>
        <p>Shine through the shadows</p>
        <p>Burn like a fire</p>

        <p>I just want to speak the name of Jesus</p>
        <p>Over fear and all anxiety</p>
        <p>To every soul held </p>
        <p>captive by depression</p>
        <p>I speak Jesus
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>

        <br>
        <p>Break every stronghold</p>
        <p>Shine through the shadows</p>
        <p>Burn like a fire</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Bridge</h5>
        <p>Shout Jesus from the mountains</p>
        <p>Jesus in the streets</p>
        <p>Jesus in the darkness </p>
        <p>over every enemy</p>
        <p>Jesus for my family</p>
        <p>I speak the holy name, Jesus</p>
        
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p> 'Cause your name is power</p>
        <p>Your name is healing</p>
        <p>Your name is life</p>
        <br>
        <p>Break every stronghold</p>
        <p>Shine through the shadows</p>
        <p> Burn like a fire</p>
