        <h5>Verse 1</h5>
        <p> How great the chasm that lay between us</p>
        <p>How high the mountain I could not climb</p>
        <p> In desperation, I turned to heaven</p>
        <p> And spoke your name into the night</p>
        <br>
        <p> Then through the darkness</p>
        <p> Your loving kindness</p>
        <p>Tore through the shadows of my soul</p>
        <p>The work is ﬁnished, the end is written</p>
        <p>Jesus Christ, my living hope</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Verse 2</h5>
        <p> Who could imagine so great a mercy?</p>
        <p> What heart could fathom such boundless grace?</p>
        <p> The God of ages stepped down from glory</p>
        <p> To wear my sin and bear my shame</p>
        <br>
        <p>The cross has spoken, I am forgiven</p>
        <p> The king of kings calls me His own</p>
        <p> Beautiful savior, I'm yours forever</p>
        <p> Jesus Christ, my living hope</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p> Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free</p>
        <p>Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me</p>
        <p>You have broken every chain</p>
        <p>There's salvation in your name</p>
        <p> Jesus Christ, my living hope</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Verse 3</h5>
        <p>Then came the morning that sealed the promise</p>
        <p>Your buried body began to breathe</p>
        <p> Out of the silence, the roaring lion</p>
        <p> Declared the grave has no claim on me</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p> Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free</p>
        <p>Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me</p>
        <p>You have broken every chain</p>
        <p> There's salvation in your name</p>
        <p>Jesus Christ, my living hope</p>
